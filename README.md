# SingleCellProteomicsTutorial

This is a tutorial for analyzing single-cell imaging proteomic data based on the analysis available finalized at this location.

The main aim of the tutorial is to demonstrate and guide the usage of imaging proteomic data, including filtering cells, performing batch normalization, and calculating a pseudotime from the expression of markers for the cell cycle. Finally, the students will work on displaying the expression of an important cell cycle regulated protein over the cell cycle.
